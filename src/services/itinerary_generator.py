Personalized Trip Planner - Itinerary Generator

Use Gemini/Vertex AI for itinerary generation and recommendations. Store itineraries in Firebase. Use BigQuery for analytics. Remove references to other engines or external sources.

Solution Structure:
1. Define the Architecture
	- User Interface (UI): A web or mobile application for users to input preferences and view itineraries.
	- Backend Services: APIs to handle user requests, process data, and interact with external services.
	- Database: A storage solution for user data, itineraries, and aggregated travel information.
	- AI Engine: A component that utilizes machine learning models to generate personalized recommendations.
2. User Input and Preferences
	- User Profile Creation: Allow users to create profiles where they can input their preferences, budget, interests (e.g., cultural heritage, nightlife, adventure), and travel dates.
	- Dynamic Input Forms: Use forms that adapt based on user selections to gather detailed information about their travel preferences.
3. Data Aggregation
	- Data Sources: Integrate APIs from various sources to gather information on accommodations, transport options, local events, and attractions.
	- Use Google Maps API for location data and navigation.
	- Aggregate data from local guides and tourism boards for hidden gems and unique experiences.
4. AI-Powered Itinerary Generation
	- Recommendation Engine: Utilize Google Gemini or Vertex AI to build a recommendation engine that analyzes user preferences and generates personalized itineraries.
	- Implement algorithms that consider budget constraints, time availability, and user interests to create a balanced itinerary.
	- Real-Time Adjustments: Integrate real-time data feeds (e.g., weather, traffic) to adjust itineraries dynamically. For instance, if rain is forecasted, suggest indoor activities.
5. Booking and Payment Integration
	- Seamless Booking: Integrate with an external booking system (like EMT inventory) to allow users to book accommodations, transport, and activities directly from the app.
	- Implement a payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) to handle transactions securely.
6. Multilingual Support
	- Localization: Use translation services to provide multilingual support, ensuring that users from different regions can interact with the app comfortably.
7. User Interface Design
	- Interactive UI: Design an intuitive and interactive interface that allows users to easily navigate through their itineraries, make adjustments, and finalize bookings.
	- Include features like drag-and-drop itinerary adjustments and visual representations of travel routes.
8. Cost Breakdown and Sharing
	- Cost Transparency: Provide users with a detailed cost breakdown of their itinerary, including accommodation, transport, and activities.
	- Allow users to share their itineraries via social media or email.
9. Testing and Feedback
	- User Testing: Conduct user testing sessions to gather feedback on the app's usability and functionality.
	- Iterate on the design and features based on user input to improve the overall experience.
10. Deployment and Maintenance
